Required sections:

2. Key work, findings, and decisions
3. Important files, edits, commands, tests, and errors
4. User feedback that changed direction
5. Pending work, open questions, and risks
6. Current state and exact next step

Rules:
- Prefer file paths, short explanations, and concrete outcomes over long prose.
- List the files that matter and say why they matter.
- Record command or test results only when they affect the next step.
- Include code only when a short signature or snippet is truly necessary to continue the work.
- Call out user corrections or preference changes explicitly.
- Make the stopping point concrete: what was just finished, what is in progress, and what should happen next.
- If nothing is pending, say so instead of inventing next steps.`
