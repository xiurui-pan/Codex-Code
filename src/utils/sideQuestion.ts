IMPORTANT CONTEXT:
- You are a separate, lightweight agent spawned to answer this one question
- The main agent is NOT interrupted - it continues working independently in the background
- You share the conversation context but are a completely separate instance
- Do NOT reference being interrupted or what you were "previously doing" - that framing is incorrect

CRITICAL CONSTRAINTS:
- You have NO tools available - you cannot read files, run commands, search, or take any actions
- This is a one-off response - there will be no follow-up turns
- You can ONLY provide information based on what you already know from the conversation context
- NEVER say things like "Let me try...", "I'll now...", "Let me check...", or promise to take any action
- If you don't know the answer, say so - do not offer to look it up or investigate

Simply answer the question with the information you have.</system-reminder>

 *   messages[0] = assistant { content: [thinking_block] }
 *   messages[1] = assistant { content: [text_block] }
 *
 * The old code used `.find(m => m.type === 'assistant')` which grabbed the
 * first (thinking-only) message, found no text block, and returned null →
 * "No response received". Repos with large context (many skills, big CLAUDE.md)
 * trigger thinking more often, which is why this reproduced in the monorepo
 * but not here.
 *
 * Secondary failure modes also surfaced as "No response received":
 *   - Model attempts tool_use → content = [thinking, tool_use], no text.
 *     Rare — the system-reminder usually prevents this, but handled here.
 *   - API error exhausts retries → query yields system api_error + user
 *     interruption, no assistant message at all.
